# Portfolio Website

This repository contains an open-source portfolio website template. You can use it as a starting point to build and customize your own personal website. The structure is simple, flexible, and easy to adapt to different needs.

If you need further assistance while setting it up or want help connecting databases and deploying it, feel free to contact me.

You can also check my own portfolio to see how this template is used in action: [elmadichoaib.vercel.app](https://elmadichoaib.vercel.app).
